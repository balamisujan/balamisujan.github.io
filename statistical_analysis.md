#### Parameteric tests

A. <ins>Test for frequency data</ins>
#### [Chi-square test](Chi-Square_Test.md)

B. <ins>Test for continous data</ins>
1. Correlation
#### Pearson Correlation test
3. Test of single group
#### [T-test](T-test.md)
#### Z-test
3. Test of more than one group
#### [One-way ANOVA](One-way_ANOVA.md)
3. Test of two categories of groups
#### [Two-way ANOVA](Two-way_ANOVA.md)
